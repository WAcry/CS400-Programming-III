Once upon a time, in a remote place lived an old man, no children, very lonely.

This old man has lived here for 30 years, never having seen another human even
once. Every day he wakes up, brews some homemade coffee and then sets off to
hunt for food, and to chop firewood. The forest around his tiny cabin is thick
and vast. Every day while hes out working in the woods, he secrectly dreams
that someone will emerge from the woods, calling his name. 

"Boooooob!" someone screams. "We are here save you!"

"We come to you from the organization that put you here in these woods. 
I know you don't remember but are a test subject here for our company.
Just to let you know, I have a life outside these woods, a family,
kids! A normal life. We are here to take you home."

The old man was surprised and he was taken home. At his home outside the forest,
He met his new family, he has a son, Tony, who is also a father of two adorable girls.
Tony got divorced and he was trying to save his love with his ex-wife, Mary. The old man decided to
help his son in his marriage. He turned to the organization that took him back for help. "Boooooom" someone
screamed, "we can help you to take Mary back, but then you have to return to the forest!" The old man agreed.
A few days later, Mary was back but old man was gone, no one knows where he went.

It is worth mentioning that the organization that drove people into the forest for the purpose of experiments 
was seized by the state, and the leader of the organization fled to the forest. 
It is said that only he knows where the old man lives.
